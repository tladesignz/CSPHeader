## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

There's nothing to see there, the Example app just serves as a host for the unit tests in `Tests.swift`,
so just execute these.

## Requirements

## Installation

CSPHeader is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'CSPHeader'
```
